                            Antonio Zuza is one half of the promising Imogen Recordings. The Croatian DJ co-runs it with Ilija Rudman, his great friend in crime who helped him to make a record with his band Bubbin’ Dub back in 2010. They ended up with a tune on House Sound Recodings’ compilation beside names such as Virgo Four, Andy Ash, Mat Chiavaroli and that is exactly where this great Imogen story starts. Since that extraordinary experience they continued developing their musical journey together and today their label is a homebase for many of the future sounds of Brand New Heavies, Dos Palos, Charles Webster, Chez Damier, Ron Trent, Darshan Jesrani, Don Carlos and of course their own music. Antonio Zuza je polovica svijetski renomirane etikete Imogen koju vodi zajedno s Ilija Rudmanom a na kojoj su zablistala izdanja Brand New Heavies, Dos Palos, Charles Webster, Chez Damier, Ron Trent, Darshan Jesrani, Don Carlos, Ron Trent, Kai Alce-a i Iljana Kabilja! Izvrstan DJ i jedna od svijetlih točaka na glazbenoj sceni.

                            We are introducing one of Dalmatia's finest sons, DJ OZ, Split based dj, co-founder of Radio Esplendor, co-owner, resident and booker at Split's hi-fi bar Adriatic Social Club. Either as a dancer, a DJ or a journalist, DJ OZ is a constant presence on Croatian clubbing scene. After 20 years of finding himself immersed in all strains of house and disco music, when caught behind the decks or making home listening mixes, OZ today promotes music that found itself somehow hidden form the top underground dance (and pop) shelves. Balearic beats, European boogie instrumentals, South African proto house jams or forgotten NY deep house classic, OZs main intention is always to make you dance and feel something.

                            Enfant terrible of house music in Croatia, Marijan Felver, started to DJ professionally at an early age of 20. In the nineties, his life revolved around “Cosmic Disco” events in Aquarius, that hosted many pioneers of the then up-and-coming northamerican electro music such as John Acquaviva, DJ Pierre and others. Clubbing and hosting experience has contributed to the creation of his own production, and his first release on German label “Blaou” under the name: “Audio Video Disco Connection : Der Kroatische Traum Ep”; that was a beginning of a collaboration with Dixon. This release bore fruit to another collaboration, with London tech-house protagonist, Gideon Jackson & SWAG record label. His active role on the then emerging scene of house music took him to the UKs most prominent “Wiggle” nights (with residents : Terry Francis, Nathan Coles) where he, more ////

BASS CULTURE SOUND SYSTEM je utemeljen 1999., kad je to ime većinu asociralo na daleku prošlost i legendarni treći album Lintona Kwesi Johnsona. U to doba rijetki su razmišljali o kulturi basa kao trajnom ishodištu različitih stilova klupske glazbe ukorijenjene u karipskim soundsystemima. Bass Culture je svojim zvukom u obuhvatio naslijeđe stare škole roots-reggaea i inovacije koje su na scenu svakodnevno donosili producenti elektronskog duba i junglea. Širenje granica kulture basa počelo je mjesečnim rezidencijama u Močvari i SKUC-u, a između njih je u kronologiju najstarijeg zagrebačkog reggae crewa upisano gostovanje na prvom Seasplashu.

                            Lots of you know Iva under the moniker Iva Starkova from times she used to spin big beat music. She’s djing since 2002 when she performed as a resident at the famous Irma Club and then at Sirup. She took a long time-out and is now back. Today, grown and mature, with different priorities in a movie we might remember. Music never disappeared from her life, and still remains her biggest love. https://soundcloud.com/iva-starkova Mnogi od vas poznaju Ivu pod imenom Iva Starkova, iz vremena kada je puštala electro i nu-beat glazbu. Glazbom se bavi jako dugo a kao DJ nastupa od 2002. godine u splitskom klubu Irma. Nakon preseljenja u Zagreb, često je birala glazbu u bivšem Sirupu, te organizirala partye u VIP klubu. Spletom okolnosti nakon tog perioda, izbiva sa scene nekoliko godina. E pa Iva više nije Starkova. Samo IVA. Danas odrasla i zrelija, s drugačijim prioritetima i filmom od onog u kojem je mi možda pamtimo. Glazba nikada nije nestala iz njena života, dapače bila je i ostala ljubav.

                            Phil Mison Producer, songwriter, musician, music critic and Dj sound pioneer Phil Mison has championed the chill-out music genre since its inception in the early-90s. Phil, who began his storied DJ career at London’s famed Milk Bar in 1991, segued into producing after a decade Djing around the world and touring with bands such as Leftfield. It was this huge knowledge of the chill-out genre that earned Mison a chance to put out his first compilation ‘Original Chill Out’ in 1995. Since then he has gone on to release a further 12 compilations (including four volumes of the hugely popular ‘Real Ibiza’ series). Cantoma’s tracks have appeared on more than 200 compilations (Buddha Bar, Café del Mar, Amnesty International), on various TV shows and movies (Sex & the City, etc.). Phil has also produced remixes for big name artists such as Grace Jones and Badly Drawn Boy to name but a few.

A cohesive, quality-driven catalogue that convincingly reflects both Igor’s diligent curation and overall eclecticism.

His formative years were spent in Pula, a small industrial town with great people, a beautiful coastline but a scarse cultural life. It was the music videos of the early nineties and a progressive local radio station that played a key role in linking him to the culture that would later express his creativity - hip hop. He spent his teenage years shaping his skills in graffiti drawing, break dancing and dj'ing in his father's garage where his friends and him assembled their first sound systems and light shows with whatever they could find at the local flea market. When he moved to Zagreb to attain a degree, it was house music that caught his ear. After a few years of digging and mixing he was recognized by Zagreb's finest crews („Ekstrakt“ and „Confusion“) and was invited ////
